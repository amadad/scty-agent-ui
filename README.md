## CopilotKit <> Agno Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [Agno](https://agno.com) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated investment analyst agent that can research stocks, analyze market data, and provide investment insights.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key (for the Agno agent)

  - pnpm (required)

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Install Python dependencies for the Agno agent:
```bash
pnpm install:agent
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `pnpm dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
